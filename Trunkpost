Within this repo you will find my SQL projects, I have sequestered branches by platform.  Within the MSSQL branch, you will find some of my notes from my certification course, along with a project showing covid cases alongside vaccination and death rates.  More to come as I get things coded.  Within the PostGRESQL branch, as of right now I am learning and reinforcing my SQL skills with a course, and I will be uploading my progress as I go.
